Suppose he should relent, and publish grace to all, 
on promise made of new subjection?
With what eyes could we stand in his presence humble 
To receive strict laws imposed,
To celebrate his throne with warbled hymns,
And to his godhead sing forced hallelujahs,
While he lordly sits, our envied sovereign,
And his altar breath ambrosial odors and ambrosial flowers,
Our serville offerings.
This must be our task in heaven; this our delight.
